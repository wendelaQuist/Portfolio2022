            <h1>KEA charette</h1>
            <p>Our study gets invited to take part in KEA Charette every few years. A few students get to participate in a design challenge with other international students.
                Some students could only participate online because of Covid this year.

            <h1>Kea-charette</h1>
            <p>In the beginning we had 2 groups working together to collect data about Nørrebro United.
                The head of the club gave our groups a tour around the neighborhood of Nørrebro and talked about the club. He talked about how the club has the most girls in Denmark and how they don’t have enough trainers. All their facilities are also public spaces so they can’t pay their trainers or use sponsors to advertise for. When we spoke to the chief it seemed that he didn’t have enough insight about the club, when we asked about the database, he said they didn’t have it, so it was hard to find the target group. To help with the volunteer shortage was also a bit tricky, because when we asked him why the volunteers leave, he gave us some examples but nothing concrete, so it seemed he didn’t reach out to the volunteers to ask what Nørrebro United could do better to keep them.
                After we spoke to the head of the club, we decided to visit one of the trainings where we interviewed some members and ex-members. When we talked to them it became clear the kids love the club and feel at home. It became very clear for us we only needed to focus on trainers.
                The day after our two groups were still together for the brainstorming which in hindsight was not a good idea. I noticed everyone had an opinion and wanted to debate everything which was super time consuming. I tried to be more laid back because If I chose to have some input it would only take longer, and we were already behind schedule.
                Our facilitators interviewed some trainers at Nørrebro United and they all said since last year the system has become much better and they have a tight inner circle. The only problem they saw was the way Nørrebro United recruits volunteers. They send out emails to their own members to ask them if they know people who want to volunteer, and even small children ask around the streets for trainers.
                After a few days our groups finally split up and we could get to work. It was very hard to think of solutions because one member kept giving suggestions that weren’t relevant to the main problem, so we kept discussing those ideas and lost a lot of time. In the end we came up with a campaign to make it more visible to the outside world how important volunteers are to NBU (Nørrebro United).

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>At the end we had to make a presentation which another member and I oversaw. I made the design and asked him to add content so we could make a smooth story out of it later. In the end there were three presentations made by three different people without any communication towards me after I uploaded everything. In the end I was working on the final presentation which was made by someone else so I learned that I should not have been laid back at all, but I need to be more stubborn next time even if it takes more time. Now I know my opinion was also valuable and there was nothing wrong with sharing it if I knew it would be a good contribution opposed to the other members.</p>
