            <h1>Movie poster: twice my age</h1>
            <p>the challenge was to design a movie poster which pictures myself at twice my current age. The poster needed to contain elements which make me happy.

        <h1>Progress</h1>
        <p>At first, I wanted to note down the stuff that would probably make me happy in twenty-one-years. I presumably would want a big modern house with a fancy sports car, which I can afford when I make enough money from my successful job. It would also be amazing to travel and see the world, so I needed to visualize that. I intendedly used recent pictures of myself because I would love to look the same in twenty-one-years.
            To look for inspiration I went searching for pictures from my own gallery, Pexels, Reddit and Pinterest to complete my picture with the help of photoshop.</p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>It was very time consuming because I still needed to learn a lot about photoshop. I used tutorials to create the effects I wanted to which was way better than just to try thing out like in the beginning.
            the feedback I received was about the footer which wasn't in line with the poster. The logos on the bottom were scattered and looked chaotic so I organized the logos and names.
