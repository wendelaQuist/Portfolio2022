            <h1>1.a. Sketching with Illustrator Graph Tool</h1>
            <p>
                My first idea was to create graphs about a technical subject. I started looking at <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/" target="_blank">Blue Origin</a> wanting to visualize the difference of power, but the engines use different propellants.
                Then I came across an article about wild life and found some info about Sea Turtle Protection at <a href="https://www.systemanaturae.org/wildlifedatasets/sea-turtle-protection/" target="_blank"> System Naturae</a>. I used <a href="https://vspca.org/pdf/VSPCA_Sea_Turtle_Report_2019.pdf" target="_blank">this</a>
                dataset which contains info about the survival rate of sea turtles eggs.

            <h1>1.b. Make your own Infographic</h1>
            <p>The first thing that came to mind was to make an infographic about my favourite universe: Star Wars. I thought it would be easy to create some appealing images, but it was much harder than expected. The most beautiful Star Wars infographics aren't about
                media history so I couldn't find good inspiration. Facts about film techniques aren't as appealing or easy to visualize so I decided to stay in the same theme as my first graph.

            <p>I chose relaxation, thrill and eroticism for my core values. When I started designing I had a picture in my head and put individual elements together, but in the end I thought it didn't look so good. After some feedback I looked at other designs
                and came up with my own executions. The designs had to be in black & white with one spot color.</p>

            <h1>2.b. Movie poster</h1>
            <p>I got to remake the poster of my favourite movie, so I choose Atlantis.The style is kind off similar to tribal patterns, so I wanted to combine this style with neon glow.
                I realized for a minimalist poster the patterns are a bit overcrowded, so I changed it to simple line art with a glow effect.
                My plan was to focus solely on Kida. For me she was the main character because she was powerful and a leader.
                I learned how to create a realistic glow by using filters in photoshop. I got some feedback and was told it would maybe look better if I only used Kida's zoomed in head instead of a small body.
                I also liked this idea but in the movie when you see Kida for the first time you have no idea of who she is or if she is important, and i tried to make Kida a little bit anonymous in the poster.</p>

            <p>For this assignment I got to use a green screen to make a chroma key scene in a different environment. 
                luckily I got to use the green screen room before the lockdown, but didn't have enough time to recreate a more polished look.
                I have never worked with Adobe After Effects, and i'm pretty proud of the short result.
