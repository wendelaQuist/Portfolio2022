              <h1>Start</h1>
              <p>I had a few ideas on my mind like for my sprint X like photography or animating. I felt like I could learn a lot if I study more about photography, but I thought it would be boring after a while.
                  When I heard more classmates wanted to animate as well and how much time goes into small projects I decided to keep looking. I have always been interested in crypto currency, because my dad talks about it a lot,
                  but I have never deepened in this topic. I talked to my father and some teachers and came up with the idea to build a crypto trading bot prototype.

              <h1>Research</h1>
              <p>At first it was important to understand crypto more. My <a href="../../Research/Research-SprintX.pdf" target="blank">research</a> was to help me understand how the virtual transactions work and what specifications my bot would need.
                  I looked at other crypto bot companies and came across <a href="https://www.onebutton.trade/" target="blank">OneButton trading.com</a>. This project was build by other Fontys students
                  and they use a brilliant system you can't find everywhere. Most crypto bots are free with limitations or you need a subscription even when you lose money. OneButton uses AI bots
                  with different strategies that only take a small part of your profit. So when you don't make any profit it won't take any money. Because this company made the ultimate trading bots I chose to not make a prototype,
                  but focus on my own branding and marketing. I wanted to make a promotion video which excites people to learn about the crypto market just like me.

              <h1>Branding</h1>
              <p class="color">Almost all crypto related apps and websites have almost the same color palette. Most of the times it's dark grey with popping colors like <p1 style="color: #0062FB;">blue</p1>, <p1 style="color: #EC6498;">pink</p1> and <p1 style="color: orange;">orange</p1> so I decided to go with the flow because I love these colors and it's more recognizable.
                  Next to the colors, I thought it would look good to give it a retro game vibe. You can paper trade on a lot of platforms, so you won't lose any real money and like a game it can be addictive in a good way. I made a Logo for my brand called: Coin Dealer and some backgrounds in illustrator

            <h1>Website</h1>
            <p>I build a website with the top 3 biggest crypto coins values in euros. I made the background in Illustrator and the site shows the current value of the crypto coins via and api connected to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/nl" target="blank">Coingecko.com.</a>
            I decided to only build a <a href="./site/crypto.html" target="blank">home screen</a> only has the home screen but if I had more time I would love to show charts and current news.</p>

              <h1>Promotion</h1>
              <p>Because crypto isn't very thrilling, I wanted to create a fun and exciting advertisement video. When you look at Tele2 ads it has little to do with phones, and it's still fun to watch.
                  I wanted to implement my branding into the video along with some other material to create a stimulating effect. I knew I wanted to use a feminine power song so I looked at the Netflix show: Selling sunset playlist
                  and came across the perfect song.
