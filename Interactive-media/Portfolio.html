              <h1>Begin</h1>
              <p>I knew I wanted to use a one-pager because it is better organized. Because I didn't have much material I decided to use buttons for my learning outcomes to take you to the pdf with content. The first page was very clear, but it was 
                  kind of clumsy when you have to open pdf's, so not user friendly at all.

              <h1>Second design</h1>
              <p>I saw some awesome ideas on Pinterest with beautiful gradients and a playful design. I had a vision and tried to work it out in Adobe XD and then implement it directly into a <a href="https://portfolioreview2.vercel.app/" target="blank">website</a>. When I got some feedback I realized the design was pretty for me, but it looked like I was just doing something
                  instead of really thinking about things like the layout my design. I started to slowly like the design less and tried to
                  play with some elements like the projects display and buttons, but for me it seemed hopeless and started looking at other designs.</p>

              <h1>Third design</h1>
              <p>Now I started designing from scratch again, but this time I looked at other designs and took some elements which I liked and combined them with the Pinterest design. When I made my designs in XD, I got the feeling it was getting more childish and overcrowded.
                  It was time to let the Pinterest design go.

              <h1>Last design</h1>
              <p>I took my time and started looking thoroughly at other designs on pinterest and Behance, but this time I also looked at layouts. I came across a beautiful Japanese style and I immediately fell in love.
                  When I was younger I randomly painted a geisha figure combined with a punk style. My aunt was very superstitious and believed she was a geisha in her former life, which she told me afterwards. She was a very kind, smart and beautiful woman who passed away from cancer in 2021.
                  I used this style as some kind of honor to her.

              <h1>Final changes</h1>
              <p>In my previous <a href="https://objective-booth-73ab80.netlify.app/" target="blank">portfolio design</a> I used cards to show my projects, but I knew I had more content so not all the cards would fit. I saw a carousel which looked very professional so I added it to my page and made some changes to make it look more visible.
                  I tried many times to add the smooth moving underlines in the navbar, and finally succeeded. The cursor blended too much with the background so I used a dot with animations to make it smooth and relaxed like the rest of the design. After some feedback
                  I also changed the first image to a more dynamic circle instead of split up in two harsh parts, which looks much better now.
