            <h1>Special week</h1>
            <p>Merijn and I were challenged to research some front end developer tools and apply it to our own project. 
                We were most interested in React and Vue. After we did our research we wanted to work with Vue, because it was easier to understand and we thought we could create a better project with it. 
                To understand Vue better we decided to do different examples. We got stuck when deciding what to do for our project, but after talking to some teachers we decided to do reverse-engineering.  
                We decided to recreate the Domino's pizza website. We didn't have enough time to build the whole website so we wanted to focus on the coupon system which I did and the ordering system which Merijn built.

            <h1>Example website</h1>
            <p>Merijn and I used different coarses and I made a website to buy socks.
                In this example I learned how to change text with an if-else statement. When you hover over different products it can display if it's in or out of stock. The next thing I learned was to make an array in Javascript and to show it in html as a list.
                I also gave the different products specifications like a product number and colors. When you hover over the colors the image will update to match the color. At last I learned to use a method to add and remove products from your cart.

        <h1>Recreation Domino's pizza</h1>
        <p>After Merijn and I practised with Vue, I started to design the website with css. I then built a coupon system with a random code generator that saves the codes in an array. I made a coupon validator that compares the inserted code to the saved codes in the list
          to see is the code is correct.
